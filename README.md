# Senior Game App

A friendly, single-page web application that lets seniors enjoy three calm games from any modern browser:

- **Mahjong Match** – pair matching with large tiles and simple controls.
- **Relaxed Solitaire** – draw-and-place foundations focused on one-step decisions.
- **Calming Tetris** – gentle-paced Tetris with keyboard and touch-friendly controls.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
2. Choose a game from the top navigation and follow the on-screen guidance.

No build tools or servers are required—the experience is completely static.

## Accessibility highlights

- Large, high-contrast controls and readable typography.
- Clear instructions for every game with live status updates.
- Keyboard support for Tetris (arrow keys and space/arrow up to rotate).

Enjoy a relaxed gaming break! 😊
